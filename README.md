VSTSTimeTrackerAddin
====================

VSTSTimeTrackerAddin is a Visual Studio 2005 addin that connects to Team Foundation Server to allow the
user to track time of development tasks. This addin was developed, as part of a University Final Degree Project, 
for a demonstration of TFS functionalities.
This addin can be installed and uninstalled from Visual Studio 2005 like any other addin.

NOTE: At the moment only users with TFS administrator permissions can track their times.
